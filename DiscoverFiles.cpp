/**
 * Class TDiscoverFiles
 *
 * Purpose
 * Given a root directory the class gathers 
 * specific files from folders and subfolders. 
 * The file types to collect is stored in a simple 
 * XML formatted file. This configuration contains 
 * the file extensions to determine which files have 
 * to be collected by the class.
 * The collected files will be stored in CSV format
 * at the time of beginning of the implementation.
 * Later these data has to be stored in a format 
 * by which the information can be easily displayed 
 * and edited (maintained) on every platform (desktop, 
 * mobile etc.).
